# Project Title

PIG DICE

## Getting Started

 These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

 Have a recent browser, such as Google Chrome or Internet Explorer and make sure that they are up to date, whichever you may choose


### Installing

 Clone from repository and open the folder called 'Ipfour' to reveal its contents. They have no infections, so it is safe to access the files.

## Running the tests

In this Pig Dice project, you will have 'player 1' and 'player2' along with buttons in which the rules are not programmed, only by human interaction and decision making can the game be played.

## Specifications

One of the players will click on their respective buttons. If roll is clicked, the program will roll the dice. If it
is above 1, the player will keep that score and it will get added to his total accumulated score and also allowed to continue rolling as long as he does not strike 1. If he does, he loses the score that has accumulated for him and his turn is passed
to the other player. 

## Deployment

Browse throught IPfour and find the index.html. The children documents should be listed in alphabetical order, in order of file types.
